# Run-Knight-Run

Run, Knight, Run! is a fast-paced 2D platformer made with the Godot engine—and yes, it’s my very first game! developed as a learning project by following a tutorial by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0" target="blank_"> Brackeys </a>. This game throws you into the shiny boots of a brave little knight with one simple mission: run, collect coins, and try very hard not to die.
